# Address book

We want to write an address book for the following characters: 

Name | Number
-----|-------
Tommy Shelby|+44 017462763
Charlotte Ritter|+49 0375274032
Perry Rhodan | +1 334873822

You are going to implement it in differnt ways:

## Address book with if statements

0. Use Scanner to take in a name
0. Use if statements to print out
  0. 0845 50 50 50 if the name is "Aaron"
  0. 00 49 12345 if the name is "Fred"
  0. 00 49 11111 if the name is "Jonas"
0. Add another name and number to our program
0. And then add another
0. And then another

## Address book with normal arrays and normal loops
## Address book with ArrayList and foreach
## Address book with Entry object
## Address book with Maps instead of loops
