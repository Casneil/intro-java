# Address book

We want to write an address book for the following characters: 

Name | Number
-----|-------
Tommy Shelby|+44 017462763
Charlotte Ritter|+49 0375274032
Perry Rhodan | +1 334873822

You are going to implement it in differnt ways:

## Address book with if statements

* Use Scanner to take in a name
* Use if statements to print out
   * 0845 50 50 50 if the name is "Aaron"
   * 00 49 12345 if the name is "Fred"
   * 00 49 11111 if the name is "Jonas"
* Add another name and number to our program
* And then add another
* And then another

## Address book with normal arrays and normal loops

* Create a normal array that stores three names as `String`s
* Create a normal array that stores three numbers as `String`s
* Use Scanner to take in a name
* Use a `for` loop to loop over the names array
  * If the name in the array equals what you found from `Scanner` then print that out

## Address book with ArrayList and foreach
## Address book with Entry object
## Address book with Maps instead of loops
