# Address book

We want to write an address book for the following characters: 

Name | Number
-----|-------
Tommy Shelby|+44 017462763
Charlotte Ritter|+49 0375274032
Perry Rhodan | +1 334873822

You are going to implement it in differnt ways:

## Address book with if statements

Write a method getNumber that accepts a name `string` and returns the telephone number of that person. If the person does not exist we return the number of a german telephone information `+49 11 88 0`
Use: 
- if
- else
- string comparison


## Address book with normal arrays and normal loops
## Address book with ArrayList and foreach
## Address book with Entry object
## Address book with Maps instead of loops
