### Loops and Math

#### Dec2Bin
Write a method that prints a given decimal numer in binary form.
```
input: 42
output: 101010
```

#### Intervallhalbierungsverfahren or Bisection method
Write a method that calculates the square root of a given numer by using the bisection method.
```
Input: 9
Output:
Iteration 1: mid=5 5*5=25 error=16
Iteration 2: mid=3 3*3=9 error=0
```

#### Calculator

### Fibonacci
Write a method that, given an input n, calculates the first n numbers of the fibonacci sequence.
The fibonacci sequence is defines as: 
```
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
```
