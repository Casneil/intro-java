# How to break down a program

Try to split your project into multiple blocks that belong together. 
- What are diffent parts of your application?
- What can be left out in the beginning?
- What is the central feature / interaction?


- Implement the part that you identified as the most important part of your program.
- Some tips:
  - Don't overthink the structure of your program.
  - Start with fixed variables and add user interaction, random content later.
  - Do not write classes.
  - Write methods only if you repeat yourself.
  - 
  - If you are stuck try to write down the logic in human words.
    - Make this more and more detailed until you know what the code should do.
 ```
// Set position the user chose to x
=> 
// Get user input
// set x
=> 
// get an integer input for x
// get an integer input for y
// map 2D to 1D
// set x in array
=> 
int x = scanner.nextInt();
int x = scanner.nextInt();
int index = y*3+x;
board.set(index, 'X');
 ```
