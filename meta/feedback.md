# ReDI - For the Future

## Student struggles
- How to solve problems
  - How to start
  - Translate a real life problem to code
- Code Structure
- Benefits of OOP
- Translate example problems from live coding into own code

## Worked good
- Exercises with some code and students extend on it
    - Prewritten tests to validate the implementations 
- Explaining an algorithm on whiteboard (dec2bin) and the students implement it
- Don't wait too long before showing first program
- Split classes on learning speed / previous knowledge
- The order of material
- Let students explain homework or project code
- Solve problem as pairs
- Live Coding with two teachers

## Worked not so good
- Scratch or other game based programming
- Let students explain code of other students
- Recursion (only use it to debuff fast students)
- Two dimensional arrays

## Slides / Sessions to add

- Comments
- How to find help when stuck
- How to google for programmers
  - Stackoverflow
  - Oracle doc
      - Show example
- Array vs ArrayList
- Reading code (in the first / second class)

## Feedback from some students
- More live coding
- Roadmap in the beginning of what we are going to to teach
- Unclear communication (homework, class content, events)
- Translating project from procedural to OOP harder than starting with classes
- Sometimes too steep learning curve from one session to another

## Teacher struggles

- Teacher communication!!!
  - Too many / too few teachers there
  - Late response in Slack
  - Unclear what was covered in previous lessons
- Better ratio of new content and exercises
 
## Next semester ideas

- One file with status updates for teachers and students
  - Write that status until next day, containing:
    - What we did, homework, struggles, ideas for next lesson
  - Post not more than 12 hours later
- Homework in own file
- Clear communication with students 
  - Homework is compulsory
  - Check homework next lesson
- fill out (teacher) attentance sheet
- To try: Always two teachers. The assistant teacher from one session is leading teacher of the next session
- Webserver for IntelliJ + JDK to speed up the download in the first session
